        "their property, where, for many generations, they had lived in so\n",
        "respectable a manner as to engage the general good opinion of their\n",
        "surrounding acquaintance.  The late owner of this estate was a single\n",
        "man, who lived to a very advanced age, and who for many years of his\n",
        "life, had a constant companion and housekeeper in his sister.  But her\n",
        "death, which happened ten years before his own, produced a great\n",
        "alteration in his home; for to supply her loss, he invited and received\n",
        "into his house the family of his nephew Mr. Henry Dashwood, the legal\n",
        "inheritor of the Norland estate, and the person to whom he intended to\n",
        "bequeath it.  In the society of his nephew and niece, and their\n",
        "children, the old Gentleman's days were comfortably spent.  His\n",
        "attachment to them all increased.  The constant attention of Mr. and\n",
        "Mrs. Henry Dashwood to his wishes, which proceeded not merely from\n",
        "interest, but from goodness of heart, gave him every degree of solid\n",
        "comfort which his age could receive; and the cheerfulness of the\n",
        "children added a relish to his existence.\n",
        "\n",
        "By a former marriage, Mr. Henry Dashwood had one son: by his present\n",
        "lady, three daughters.  The son, a steady respectable young man, was\n",
        "amply provided for by the fortune of his mother, which had been large,\n",
        "and half of which devolved on him on his coming of age.  By his own\n",
        "marriage, likewise, which happened soon afterwards, he added to his\n",
        "wealth.  To him therefore the succession to the Norland estate was not\n",
        "so really important as to his sisters; for their fortune, independent\n",
        "of what might arise to them from their father's inheriting that\n",

        "\n",
        "The old gentleman died: his will was read, and like almost every other\n",
        "will, gave as much disappointment as pleasure.  He was neither so\n",
        "unjust, nor so ungrateful, as to leave his estate from his nephew;--but\n",
        "he left it to him on such terms as destroyed half the value of the\n",
        "bequest.  Mr. Dashwood had wished for it more for the sake of his wife\n",
        "and daughters than for himself or his son;--but to his son, and his\n",
        "son's son, a child of four years old, it was secured, in such a way, as\n",
        "to leave to himself no power of providing for those who were most dear\n",
        "to him, and who most needed a provision by any charge on the estate, or\n",
        "by any sale of its valuable woods.  The whole was tied up for the\n",
        "benefit of this child, who, in occasional visits with his father and\n",
        "mother at Norland, had so far gained on the affections of his uncle, by\n",
        "such attractions as are by no means unusual in children of two or three\n",
        "years old; an imperfect articulation, an earnest desire of having his\n",
        "own way, many cunning tricks, and a great deal of noise, as to outweigh\n",
        "all the value of all the attention which, for years, he had received\n",
        "from his niece and her daughters.  He meant not to be unkind, however,\n",
        "and, as a mark of his affection for the three girls, he left them a\n",
        "thousand pounds a-piece.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mr. Dashwood's disappointment was, at first, severe; but his temper was\n",

        "and by living economically, lay by a considerable sum from the produce\n",
        "of an estate already large, and capable of almost immediate\n",
        "improvement.  But the fortune, which had been so tardy in coming, was\n",

        "have been made still more respectable than he was:--he might even have\n",
        "been made amiable himself; for he was very young when he married, and\n",
